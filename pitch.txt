"Good morning ma, 
I have visited your facebook page on social media — This is very good for for visibility. 

But here’s the truth ma: social media is great, but it is a rented space. Algorithms change, accounts can get hacked, and you don’t own your audience. facebook owns it.  

With a website you own your own digital shopfront that’s open 24/7 which gives your business more visibility and trust and puts you in full control.

When someone finds you on Facebook or Instagram — its great! But where do they go next? A website helps them view all your products at their convinience, tells your brand story, links them directly to you through whatsapp, take bookings or payments, and even collect customer contacts and emails for future marketing — all in one place, without the usuall social media distractions, fully under your control.

You can "Start small — just 3 pages: Home, Products and Contact — and grow from there."

A beautiful 3-page site that matches your brand and links with your whatsapp and social media pages can turn more visitors into actual paying customers. Just one or two sales from serious buyers who find you on Google or refers your link can cover the cost."

We can also use Google visibility: "People search online through google — if you’re not there to repond, they go to your competitors."

I have been working on a clean but mobile-friendly website that can summarize your products and shows off your brand beautifully and works with your whatsapp and Instagram or Facebook.

This website can also be expanded to showxase all of your products whenever you choose to.
